# Analysis-on-student-survey
This project is aimed at analysing student opinion over current education in colleges.
The project has been accomplished in 2 stages as:
1. Survey design and data collection. A survey was created and subsequently distributed among various student groups to obtain the responses. The survey involved collection of data such as:
  a. Demographic information </br>
  b. Education details involving current academic year, field of study, and college location among others. <br>
  c. Opinions for teaching methods being predominantly used and their effectiveness, frequency of using online resources and overall quality of education. <br>
  d. Opinions over course diversity, sought after skills for career development, colleges providing adequate skill development opportunities and various other questions aimed at skill development and job readiness. <br>
  e. Open ended question as a form of feedback.


2. The survey responses were cleaned for irregularities and the following analysis were conducted: <br>
  a. Chi square test of independence - To determine correlation between attributes such as job readiness & practical experience, and education satisfaction & teaching method effectiveness. <br>
  b. ANOVA test - To determine if there is a difference between education satisfaction based on program being pursued and difference between education satisfaction based on college location. <br>
  c. F Test - For variance of job readiness between students that have practical experience and those who don't.

3. Visualizations were created for: <br>
   a. Distribution of students based on age, gender and academic year. <br> 
   b. Distribution of students job readiness confidence based on presence of their job experience.<br>
   c. Preferred area of education improvement, and most preferred aspect for career development, among others.
